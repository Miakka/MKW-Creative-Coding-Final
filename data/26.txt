Whoo hoo! Word doc, holler at ur girl.Today I:Ate waaay too much. Not that I’m turning anorexic, but this ice cream is turning out to be the bane of my existence. I feel so guilty every time, and yet… it keeps drawing me back.Got annoyed with the white boys I work with. Because well, they’re white boys, and hence are inherently annoying. The cockiness makes me want to slap to someone.Talked to CDO on gmail chat. It was awkward. The person who I felt like I could talk to forever, I now have nothing to say to. It’s sad.Found out Kanye was going on tour with NERD, Lupe, and Rhianna. This made my head explode. Partially from the awesomeness, but also because on my previous 5 am chat with Khaliah I told her that the only time I’d really step out of my “character” (read: do what I wanted to do and not feel dumb) with Christien is if NERD had a concert in NYC, because he’d be the only person I’d want to go with. And lo, there is the concert.Doesn’t mean I’m going to invite him though.I just don’t know, I can’t take the sadness of it all. It’s like being around a ghost.Talked to Anneka via email, who notified me that her inbox has been flooded with resumes after the request she sent me. She really doesn’t know how real this minority game is. When someone says they got the hook up, you go.I guess this is the section where I again say something about CDO. But my mouth is too tired, my mind weary, I can’t begin to detail how I think of him every day, how he’s in everything I do. It’s too much, it’s become subconscious, I don’t even try to stop myself anymore. I just let myself drift away.I try to be patient. I try not to think the end.But I just don’t see the endpoint. I like no one. And those that I like don’t like me.
