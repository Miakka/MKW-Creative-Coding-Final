alright this one will have to be ultimately brief, because I damn near forgot. That'd be a shady ass start.

Went to work, increasing suspicion that Dan is a racist. I don't trust that boy, and believe I have found a face for all those e-gansters that talk mad racist shit on the internets.

Feeling ill, congestion reaching new levels of annoyance. No one can understand me, and like teasing me for it. 

Still have yet to recieve last paycheck from Left right, tired of stalking jeremy gould. He claims the check may be ready for monday, i'm truly fed up with those bastards.

Cleaned up the apt for mom and kamillah's visit this weekend, picked kamillah up from penn station and went to eat at brgr. She cracks me up.

I am ever poor and considering new ways to make money, including, but not limited to selling the ipod touch, the old laptop, and perhaps trying a foot fetish party. Waitressing? Rich boyfriend? I fantasized on the train how great it would be just to have a man who would buy my groceries and monthly subway pass. That could save me about $200.

Alex emailed me back (can I change his name? I'm just saying, you know I'm paranoid. AV? I guess left right really did rub off on me). I really enjoy that man, he cracks me up. Hoping to make forward progress beyond texting and emailing, he has eclipsed CDO in daydream fantasy minutes, which is no small feat. The only concern is his big mouth, and the even bigger mouths that surround him. I don't want to have to go in hiding just to get a decent date out the kid. Not to mention some semblance of a lack of ambition could prove to be problematic in the future. But I guess that's what we would call putting the cart before the horse.
