The gift and the curse...


My day in short:

Work was busy, as usual. I never feel like I'm getting ahead.

Went out with Amanjah today, talk about blast from the past. He was:

45 minutes late.

A talker, but not much of a conversationalist (read: he talked about himself the most).

Cheaper than I remembered him.

Adventurous, which I can appreciate, cause we ended up at this Complex mag party I wanted to go to.

At the party I ran into various guys I know, who all seemed ambiguously gay, including Nadia's brother, who, as adorable as he is, had a high pitched voice and seemed unarguably gay.

Overall an interesting night, you know I love an adventure.

Lets just hope I get up in time to go to the gym.
