Soo I just got through video chatting my freshman boo (who by the way is not only NOT a freshman, but 21 now).

He's so adorable. Like a puppy. I just want to cuddle him.

As for the rest of my day, work, cooking, etc.

Nothing else of much note.

Went to the gym even though I only got about 5 hours of sleep. Still chugging along though, surprisingly.

That's about it.
