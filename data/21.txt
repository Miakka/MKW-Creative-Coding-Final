Today I:

tried to increase my productivity. This included working at home :-/

went to work and briefly wanted to slap a coworker.

had a spinach salad and pooped.

watched television that left no mark.

decided not to go out with Amanjah. I couldn't fake interest twice in one week with the same person. I don't have that much energy.

thought about writing more for money. Intended to come home and strike up a plan, did not do it.

learned I may be receiving my check from Left Right tomorrow. Plotted on what I would do with it. At least go to the bookstore.

talked to CDO briefly on gmail chat. No comment.
