what to say this is my new computer i was excited until i found those bastards at mac didn't put a legitimate text editing application so instead i have to write on this crappy thing until i can filch one off someone else i'm trying to focus on writing because i keep thinking write write however i'm distracted american psycho is on hbo and it's fascinating creepy and od it should be a cult hit they really make the guy into some type of loveable asshole and they make the 80s seem like a drug filled fuck fest interesting really i will do anything to avoid writing really i'm watching the minimalist with mark bitman on the new york times website he's making pernil a pig's shoulder i don't even like pork howeer it some how passes as capitivating i like this mac thing though i can write and watch tv at the same time without scantly moving my eyes oddly this pernile thing looks really good sometimes i think i'd like t oexpand my diet to pork and beef and all types of foodie fare however i don't think that's going to happen instead i'm going the health nut route cutting out dairy products dessert and juice yea i think that's fair and also maybe white sugars this is probably really ambitious in fact i know it is but i got to try so here's the concept i'm going to try to write something every day this year that's right every day 365 at the end who know's what i will get if nothing else a detailed account of my 2008 maybe i'll be better for it maybe it'll be shit and i don't know i'll go fuck myself but it's something to try right something to get this writing monkey off my back and maybe tame my crazy you know less talking aloud to myself saying regretable things in public calling people i don't need to call for the sake of conversation hopefully better decision making i don't know it sounds like a real corny project like i'm a fucking cliche but i'm sure i am to a certain extent so i must live with that so day 1 i watched sex and the city american psycho a bit of real sex just enough so i could masturbate myself to sleep yes i'm shooting for candor what the fuck is the point of talking to myself if i can't keep it real and a bit of batteries not included too much shit really then i got bored and debated leaving the house deciding rather to call some folk who didn't answere their phones to end up deciding to go to the movies with adam gutherie i'm wondering if that was necessarily a good idea but it's too late now plans have been made and i'm ten away from walking out the door we'll see how this turns out also out of chronoligical order but of equal importance is the fact that karimah and her boyfriend jeremy slept on my couch last night or rather this morning 5 am to be exact and i felt some type of way like dang jeremy has grown up he's funny seems nice why is he with her i'm cuter wrong i know but still i had to just eat it like lesson learned got to give people a chance to grow up can't change how you were feeling at the time yada yada fuck it now i've come back from the movies with adam trying to squeeze in my last few notes before i rush myself to sleep adam really is funny he makes me laugh like i laugh with my family and that's big my family makes me want to piss myself most times it's still awkward though like trying to find a space for all our unfinished ends making it all make sense and normal like the awkward shifts between flirting and friends i suppose it will all work itself out we just need to find our old rhythm whatever that is the movie kite runner was alright but not as good as the book the main actor was garbage alrighty day two watching music and lyrics i love hugh grant he's just so funny and british and while this isn't the greatest movie in the world i'm compelled by the songwriting element i want to write a song however all in all it's not a great movie it's making me sleepy amazing the things that get made these days so today i went to work first day back after the new year not much to report sit at a desk send a bunch of emails think about things like making a reality show about a club perhaps specifically taz of dream ahem excuse me love fame it seems like an obvious idea to do a show about a club so much so that it worries me that it hasn't been done but i get that excited tingling adrenaline rush like oooh this could be good this could be really good this could be my ticket out of the ghetto or something i'm hoping not to drop the ball i need a break i didn't think about christien too much today isn't that great i just keep thinking to write him an open letter of things i couldn't say to him or was saving to say or just never got around to telling him i don t though mostly because i'm lazy and also because my mood towards him fluctuates so much i'd probably lose interest in what i was writing so it'll have to wait until a really low point until then i've resolved to enjoy the various men in my lives for their various purposes which in my mind will include a lost marathon with alex but again we'll see i get lazy i lose interest the story of my life i gave up sweets white sugar and white flour and now i'm craving them like an addict i was already weak today i had a cupcake at work forbidden fruit is so tempting even though after i scarfed down the cupcake in 3 bites i realized it wasn't that great not only because i inhaled it and didn't chew but also because i'm so doggone congested only one forth of my tastebuds are operating at this point yet and still i want it bad i got the crackhead itch god and of course now on project runway they're doing a candy challenge i want to gnaw my arm off arrgh to add insult to injury i had two tablespoons of peanut butter to curb my sugar fix but justthe thought that i did that makes my stomach turn ew a rock bottom moment these 365 days are going to be slow and boring if i don't come up with anything interesting to say ooh oh i went to the gym the end whoo ise done a lot of typing today you now how i get talking to a certain someone and it's all clickity clack clack click right now we're debating the merits of the recording industry and pharrell's capacity to make teyana taylor a star i say no of course he says yes cue the tape we've seen it all before earlier i sent him like a 3 page email in response to a posited question about how artists can make it in the new industry that boy sure does know how to get me riled up moving forward another day at the office bites the dust i did a lot of iming and talking today and then 4 diff l r people wanted to hit me up on some chatty chatty brian trying to hit on my sister which is awkward and if he ever even tries to catch me with the side eye like what if i might have to tell him to go kill himself webster inviting me to some party for the 2nd time via text and webster saying he missed me them dudes need to stop the only one who can cross the line is my precious precious alex he's so cute i just want to bite him talked to him today too via text and then email you know that fool's email address is johnnyyutah8050 i was loling for hella long he's so young and alas that's why it could never work cause i don't think that fool's serious about his future but he'd be fun for the meantime in between time i'm just saying i wish he wasn't such a pussy he could at least hold time with me for a second back to cdo he also got me all riled up about a site he's considering creating to help break artists and you know me i get all exciting coming up with ideas writing myself into the plot getting gas you know the deal typical kia's imagination running away from her fare speaking of boy problems i talked to sandy last night more drama of kirk him acting like he doesn't like her but liking her all the same i think i'm going to end up as the last one holding on to the virginity i saw it all laid out like a movie plot the last dinosaur roll credits alright this one will have to be ultimately brief because i damn near forgot that'd be a shady ass start went to work increasing suspicion that dan is a racist i don't trust that boy and believe i have found a face for all those e gansters that talk mad racist shit on the internets feeling ill congestion reaching new levels of annoyance no one can understand me and like teasing me for it still have yet to recieve last paycheck from left right tired of stalking jeremy gould he claims the check may be ready for monday i'm truly fed up with those bastards cleaned up the apt for mom and kamillah's visit this weekend picked kamillah up from penn station and went to eat at brgr she cracks me up i am ever poor and considering new ways to make money including but not limited to selling the ipod touch the old laptop and perhaps trying a foot fetish party waitressing rich boyfriend i fantasized on the train how great it would be just to have a man who would buy my groceries and monthly subway pass that could save me about 200 alex emailed me back can i change his name i'm just saying you know i'm paranoid av i guess left right really did rub off on me i really enjoy that man he cracks me up hoping to make forward progress beyond texting and emailing he has eclipsed cdo in daydream fantasy minutes which is no small feat the only concern is his big mouth and the even bigger mouths that surround him i don't want to have to go in hiding just to get a decent date out the kid not to mention some semblance of a lack of ambition could prove to be problematic in the future but i guess that's what we would call putting the cart before the horse i am hungry the last meal i had was around 4 pm at houston's with mom and kamillah but i got gas so bad i hadn't really the desire to eat anything else but now it's 12 17 am and my stomach's grumbling what to do kamillah rightfully guessed that i had been writing in my diary last night i'm suspicious as to how she could have guessed but i suppose i'm not half as sneaky as i imagine or else she really could have been reading my journal in which case i want to take the opportunity to clear the air about how i really feel about her she is a poopy head that said i guess i open myself wide open to ridicule today mom flew in and we went to saks' shoe department i sooo want to have some money i want to be able to take my mom and sister shopping and get them whatever they want i want to be able to give them stuff more than i want to buy myself stuff though i want to do that too then after eating a tasteless meal at houston's only because i still cannot breath through my nose we headed to church the creflo preached on the covenant abraham had with god and how through his unwaivering faith he was able to recieve his blessing it was at the manhattan center and extremely packed mom was excitied for the word and talked to dad about it especially re the house situation she told him about how when carla jones gave her this expensive set of baby monitors god told her to save them for her new house but god always talks to my mom i wished he'd talk to me and maybe he does and maybe i doubt him but perhaps he could speak justa little louder or clearer it'd be nice to be able to separate fantasy and dream from prophecy i'd like to not waste my time thinking of things that will never come to pass taxi'd it home watching potter just finished an email to av clever man he is i try to not force anyone's hand in dating me that whomever god will have me to have will come to me yet in still i get impatient and think about coaxing av on a date however i'm afraid spiritually we're completely incongruous so it'd all be for naught anyway yestyerday i forgot to write my day away now it seems as though it's far away oooh here's what happened yesterday curtains yesterday my congestion hit new heights i woke up in my mom's cramped and crappy hotel room in a pissy ass mood mad cause it was sunday night mad cause we were all going to be going our separate ways over the next few hours mad cause i was a mouth breather i hate being a mouth breather i feel like my health is getting out of control like this congestion just won't go away and i think my sister diagnosed me with acid reflux i swear i just want to stop eating all together eff it i can't taste anyway i woke up on khaliah's bed i had decided to sleep there after tossing uncomfortably on the couch for about 30 minutes then laying very stiffly on her bed for about another hour i just didn't want her to walk in on me sleeping on her bed i know i'd be pissed but then i realized that i'm anal and moody it doesn't take much to piss me off khaliah wouldn't care at all she's mad laid back sometimes agravatingly so but nonetheless she's never had any real beef with me we've had our spats but for the most part she takes my crazy moodiness in stride so i decided the lesson i'm to learn from our time in cohabitation is to be more laid back in my living situation and not to sweat the small stuff they're just things they're not people we ended up downtown me and kamillah wandering listless and cold through soho continuing our one day when we're rich pinenings miu miu pronounced mew mew my new favorite fashion designer had astonishingly fabulous works of art on 3 inches as the sales people promptly ignored us and instead played dress up with the merchandise magnolia barker broke my diet i'd like to say that i had to because magnolia bakery is the only stable relationship i have in this city however in truth they're liquid crack and taste good even when i'm congested though in hindsight i'm still not sure if it was worth it but in midtown i suffered through a jaunt at abercrombie and fitch and finally settled on a nap in the hotel room nestled next to the human furnace dinner brought fast break 2 chicken pasta alfredo bread and a taste of chocolate molten cake with ice cream it wasn't even that good today today i decided to take control of my congestion or so i thought in reality i unknowingly surrendered control of my bowels it's called oil pulling it's based on ayurvedic medicine in india which deals with lots of different complicated and convoluted ideas about the balance in the body etc etc the practice is to swish and chomp an oil around in your mouth for about 10 minutes and it's supposed to draw the toxins out of your saliva and hence cure a bevy of illnesses including cancer headaches and for me most importantly congestion mad people on the internet posted stories about how it made them feel so much better so fast they could breathe their teeth was whiter etc etc i did my ten minutes it was disgusting then headed to the gym somewhere around 40 minutes later the grumbling started and then it got bad really bad bad like i had to take my jacket off in the elevator just to speed my preparation bad like i was afraid i'd see an oil slick in the toilet bad like i had to take a 20 minute power nap and go to work late alas at work there was nothing to report this was the last day without the boss unfortunately it's been quiet but i'm waiting for the storm i just can work so slow sometimes i get caught up in reading about various unrelated things intellectual star gazing and the like that the entire day can escape me but i know once i get the swing of things and find my rhythm everything should go alot faster watching the primary results in dixon new hampshire the first district to report in the state barak won it's crazy i never really thought i'd see a black president in my lifetime apocalypse now lunch with mom soup salad stomach pains sushi for dinner stomach pains updated lauren on our friends courtney's f cking to pay bills dionne's pregnant and isn't sure who the father is great stuff really it's like dodging bullets the small choices we all make and the targets it rockets you out to talked to av the light of my text life got email from cdo the light of my email life that works enough for the time being i'm happy to be busy better than i was two months ago even if triflin left right has yet to get me my money even if i am rich slightly tipsy went to maracas with pals will being crunk as usual chanel brandy being elitist as usual jendayi making me feel like i'm fun bobby i can't be your entertainment still no check from left right why do i feel bad about asking people for what's rightfully mines oh yea because i know left right sucks and they have a habit of pilling on more tasks than a person could possibly handle i need to sell this ipod i need to get this computer fully set up and arranged michael was back today but all went fairly smooth peter greenburg's asst is an idiot but whatever it got up in the 60s today chuck is here oh favorite sike congestion down sore throat up an average day work laundry gym eating something allowed myself to become affect by cdo the trigger was a conversation about the song i don't know why i love you very appropriately i was all excited about it but not only had he heard this particular cover by brand new heavies he was familiar with the original and unimpressed it seems illogical to be sadden by this but i was i need to stop loving him it ain't good for me my little heart can't take it i just hinge everything on him one word and he can throw my day out of whack granted i think i recover faster these days but still it's sad i fear love will always make me illogical then i fear i'll never love anyone else like he's it for me and i scared him away with my crazy antics hell i scare myself but it's like i just wait for him like i'm that eager puppy in the window pick me pick me and sometimes he looks and slightly smiles and then sometimes he doesn't see me at all he never buys me but i always feel like i'm one tail wag away a pathetic analogy for a pathetic situation very fitting i just don't see where this is all going like should i give up forever just charge it to the game like i'm not meant to date i never love but when i do i love too hard it'll never work because that's how i feel somehow i blame the end of cdo and i on me like if there was just something i could have done or not done maybe it wouldn't have ended but he makes me neurotic and no one wants someone who's neurotic and i wish i could just cut him out of my life but the memory's so strong i struggle to let it go to imagine my life without him to make future plans without considering where he factors in if i got a tattoo what would he think i stopped smoking wouldn't he be proud he'd like this dress everything is quietly done for him even if he doesn't know it and maybe he never will he probably won't but the fact remains that boy is my weakness and i lose all sense in regard to him it doesn't even hurt anymore it's just sad like someone's died and frustrating the cliched ness of it all and annoying because it's been 3 years and i haven't come remotely close to being involved with anyone who makes me feel even a fraction of the way i did when i was with him that's disheartening that and the fact that i've wrote these words a thousand times frowned the same frown ached the same heartache shed the same tears for so long nothing the groundhog day of my romantic life nothing ever changes and as always dear god please throw me a bone prayed that one a bunch too i also tried to get over jealousy today but as of now i'm too deflated to think of anything beyond how pitiful i truly am i feel without hope and utterly abandoned and all this because of a stupid song so sensitive fuck i never knew how much love could hurt till i loved you congestion depleting as are spirits day 2 strike 2 offender today was av who besides giving what felt like a a lukewarm response to my email and completely ignoring my questions about love launched into a diatribe about why he understands why the husband cheated on his wife because men need sex and cut no need to go any further no need to even respond to the email i don't really need him as a friend granted i enjoy him as a friend but no thanks i fear he may have been giving me very extensive mixed signals and that would be way too traumatic to endure again so my cynicism is up optimism down i really don't see a love thing working out with him or anyone besides that dive on the darkside an avarage day my boss drove me nuts with his tardiness and neediness i really want to start yelling at him like he's a child i feel like that would help however i'm learning to just dead myself to it like whatever if he's late that his explanation to spew went to a producer's guild screening with jenile at the soho house it's really fly and i was torn between wanting to belong and never coming back again exclusivity has that effect on me most times it was a really awful movie about sex trafficking home now and tomorrow's friday whoo hoo i need a boost or god throw me a bone drunk don't really know what to do with that went out with the old l r ppl av was there he's really like my best friend this fool sticks by my side the whole night and still i am unsure but it matters not it would not work morally we are incompatible so that is that hang it up wood today was busy i got frustrated by calendar shenanigans and dan's complusion to get things done fast as opposed to right but i try to remind myself to whoo sah not take things so seriously i'll be okay i still like my job met keysha and shanel and nikki after drinks w l r at applebee's to say hi really don't want to do a day of tourism not really my kicks really i'm conflicted about av like i reallt enjoy his company however i really believe i should spare myself the heartache more drinking but less drunk sober really today was a slightly touristy day filled with things i did not need to buy like 2 20 dresses from h m and liquor i never need to buy liquor however i had fun keysha shanel crack me up i had a good ten minute tears in the eye laugh about this guy on the train wearing nike sneakers and winnie the pooh socks h m then free cupcakes at magnolia courtesy of the coach store on bleecker uptown to change clothes though not much change at all on to sea in brooklyn where we met nikki and kelli kelli brought jumar they're a really strong couple to me who brings their boyfriend to dinner with the girls odd finished the night at jendayi's playing taboo with the folk good times a good clean saturday night night listening to my moody heartsick playlist it's pretty good though in a very sad way on the train ride down to 34th street keysha asked about christien and then i spiraled down back in the mix of it all not in a horrible cry me a rive way but just oh lord send me a sign so i can securely feel some type of way instead of this gray i had to write about it on the train though it was really brief luckily i just took a brief detour in vanity via my cocophane of facebook pictures and i'm back fuck it all that's what i think today i helped keysha and shanel miss their bus kill time to get on the next one which included some nasty fried chicken wings ok i'm lying they were good but fried food is inherently nasty and then finally saw them off on their bus ride back to dc then it was back uptown and too the grocery store where i spent way too much money started my period at the checkout it felt like a bubble was bursting i swear i hate it came back enjoyed some leftovers and a magnolia's cupcake and then did my hair finally it came out ok talked to brad which pretty much felt like nails on a chalk board ok it wasn't that bad but i really wasn't and do not enjoy his conversation he does not capture my imagination but i also think i'm super analytical and difficult to deal with and pessimistic and reactionary and self depreciating dear god please send me a sign a word something that i will love again or rather more importantly that i will love and it will be okay i will not scare him or myself away please also let me know if that man is christien douglass oliver thanks kia chillin and it's nice the way i like it music and lights today i went to work it was the same old same old meetings calendar repeat i ain't mad at it though left right was truly some dark employment days for me and those fools still ain't give me my last paycheck i envisioned myself sending a scathing email that burnt them to their very core then i remember to pray that it doesn't come to that because i honestly don't want to have to go through all that i feel like i've been fighting over money for months now first verizon now this i hate feeling like people are getting over on me because they think i'm too lazy to stalk them talked to lauren she broke up with her boyfriend david i'm kind of glad if only because i know how easy it is for lauren to convince herself of love that she may never really know it in it's organic state but then again do i talked to sandra we decided i would try to trick av into a date i don't know if it's the best idea but i truly do enjoy him so we shall see how the spirit leads me tomorrow speaking of leading spirits i prayed god would make the cdo situation clearer that i would learn to love or let go still waiting to hear back but i know he'll say something almost forgot tonite almost khaliah chuck are playing alicia keys in the other room more annoying than chuck being over here chuck being over here and having to listen to alicia keys it's slow torture i know i'm going to wake up with her songs in my damn head and i just walked out my room in some short shorts thinking they were both in the room and lo there he was fuck it it's my apartment too you want to be here 3 days a week that's what you're going to see regardless today started out rough no hot water fight with maintenance man sold ipod for too cheap 200 learned i'll prob never see that check from left right boss' inability to adhere to a timely schedule and general frantic disorganization but let us not dwell instead i go to the end tamika's surprise party where i'm in whitney's apartment dancing with pals to music that we sing that made the day okay quickly quickly i am very sleepy work was work meetings calls etc repeat khaliah haltingly invited me to dc for renee's birthday it felt like a pitiful after thought i'm not sure if i would go where would i stay plus i hate feeling like the 5th wheel and wishing i was back home i'm not sure if i'm up for the trip much rather just go to the movies with av but who knows if that would really happen and how much i'd enjoy it in the end still no email response from cdo i need some more hobbies this pining after men i do not have schtick is getting old and i really don't have many stories to tell these days sleepy i go to bed exhausted but then wake up an hour before my clock goes off not much to report no word on the movies with av no idea what i'll do this weekend maybe go to dc maybe stay here maybe go home to buffalo went to the gym today and my legs have been sore all day watching the last king of scotland haven't said a word to khaliah all day and she's sitting on the other end of the couch that's the awkward nature of our relationship i'm feeling some kind of way about a lot of things the whole perplexity of my feelings over av i practice being indifferent but it's not really effective i don't really want to be rejected but who does i'm skeptical of my ability to have honest feelings for someone and not fuck it up in some way i babysit my inbox looking for signs something to give me hope in things i cannot see i get nothing not a response not a text not a call and for the most part i believe myself to be okay with it i try to busy myself with other things anything not to bemoan my current situation you know the whole wanting what you have deal but it's only a few that i miss and only one i believe has any hope for success though it seems entirely far fetched at this point so then what i try not to think about it god has been particularly tight lipped about this i've not a glimmer of a sign that something is a stir that help is on the way av is the only person that i feel like i've genuinely liked in a long while though it's not on a cdo level and i have no idea of his feelings for me i don't want the friend talk and even beyond that the situation looks as if it would be so temporary we're so different and i'm not even sure what his spiritual life is like so i couldn't necessarily say that god hand picked him for me so i wait hoping waiting worrying 2 13 in the morning it's not what you think no i am not coming back from some great and conclusive date i did not spend the evening with anyone spectacular that roused romantic feelings in me that did not happen he was unsure of his ability to make it in a timely fashion and i in turn did a friend outing with aj and darrell me and av might reschedule i put the ball in his court but i'm also not holding my breath so instead of coming home and sulking sulking over the fact that my plan failed that i had done my hair worn make up high heels and that one of my coworkers guessed what time it was before i could even get a hint i decided that i would not let my failure defeat me no despite how bad i wanted to feel at my prospective rejection aj swooped in and saved the day through some miraculous plan of events and i decided to soldier on through my friday night high heeled boots and all and so we ended up at the whitney where after waiting outside for approximately 20 minutes to get in we saw the kara walker exhibition i have to give it to the whitney they choose some really good shows her's was a striking composition of female reflections of slavery all silohetted and cartoonish it was comical and obscene at points but i liked it i especially liked her video installations with the puppetry darrell talked all kinds of foolishness about disliking white people and other sweeping opinions that only warranted a nod and smile in response i think both aj and i were a bit derailed by his overarching opinions then on to a dinner that served me nasty chicken slouvaki which i returned and then the movies at time square to see there will be blood i slept through some parts but still managed to grasp the general plot it was okay the music was crazy but in a completely good way and now i'm home it's 2 24 am who knows what the weekend holds dc maybe my motivation is lacking i'm trying not to get down on myself yet it is so tempting i'm not sure what the solution is stay here or go to dc i've concluded since really pretty little mistakes that life rewards risks and i should therefore take more risks good risks though so what's riskier staying here or going there i'm not sure i hope god delivers some revelation in the morning to save my weekend thus far it's off to a shaky start it's a two fer though today doesn't consist of much at all so yesterday morning i woke up debating going to dc do i or don't i do i or don't i i didn't want to look like the lame party crasher surprisingly my mom put her foot down like stop over thinking things it's not that serious just go have fun so i went i had fun it all worked out fine donniesha picked me up from the bus station met up with the girls at whole foods had some sushi went back to renee's studio and got dressed then headed out to this really nice restaurant called oja which was black owned and had a really great dinner but you know how i am too much to drink and i really can't taste anything then on to xayna's hotel room in dupont circle where a few smoked while the rest just danced around and acted a fool after we attempted to go out to some club in georgetown it was whack me donneisha and khaliah didn't want to pay so we sat in the car until renee and the rest left the club this took approximately 45 minutes then up in the morning and back on a bus to dc overall i had a good time i'm glad i went i definitely learned i overthink things waay too much hopefully i'll learn to go with the flow more take more risks stop thinking everyone's against me however it was hard being in georgetown it mad me sad and ache thinking about him us in the neighborhood it amazes me how 2 short months of interaction can overrule years of memories but they do and so it made me a little disgruntled not at him but at god i know i romanticize things imagine the past more beautiful than it ever was but at the same time it was so real and i've never felt anything else like it and four years later it is still there thus i felt feel a little abandoned by god or maybe that i've been wait listed like it's ok if i don't get a new boo fine whatever i've really come to terms with being single right now my cynicism is reaching new highs in regards to my love life so having a boo right now that's whatever i can find other things to occupy my time but wanting him all the time and not having him it's painful it hurts and sucks on so many levels not even counting the thought that while i'm spending all this time and energy thinking about him i can scantly imagine him spending a fraction of the time and energy over me all the countless writing i've done encyclopedias worth of writing for what for what if only a great american novel would haunt me like the memory of this man maybe then all this pain would be worth it but what else am i supposed to do i keep trying think of new ways to avoid the heartache this includes never checking his facebook page however this is hard when my friends not only check his page but comment on all his pictures then i go a little crazy like today when i saw how lauren had commented on the pictures he had posted it's bad enough he had posted pictures i really like to imagine his life is miserable that he does nothing and is boring but that he's doing fun things taking pictures sharing them and my friends are commenting on them well it makes my stomach turn it makes me so angry with rage that i am still here still feeling these petty ways and so alone in it there's no one to talk to about it no one to sympathize because when i talk about it i feel crazy but i bottle it up so much that when i do talk about it it comes out sputtering and messy incoherent and crazy like today when khaliah had to catch an explosion after i ventured on facebook and she doesn't really understand it and there's really nothing anyone can say to console me so every effort is futile and so i continue to practice my number one method try not to think about it anything anyone else but not him not this i am hurting and the hurt feels incredibly isolating i just want to go away from it all i am definitely dropping the ball i was in the bed under the covers when it occured to me busy worrying about the what ifs of life people's health the unexpected turns that take place and turn your world on end my imagination runs away from me often not much to report from today mlk day and yet mines was definitely a day off i'm somewhat sad to report went to the gym it was cold as hell outside so i spent the rest of the day watching television completely unproductive but i think i deserved one day of slothfullness spoke with amanjah an old la jump off we're supposed to get up tomorrow so that should be interesting watched the wire brandon invited me to some party his mom is throwing him this weekend i think i might go i contemplated doing things with him that might confuse situations besides just going there in the first place might do those things too though what can i say i guess i'm feeling a bit reckless or selfish or both that said rarely do the things i imagine come to pass the gift and the curse my day in short work was busy as usual i never feel like i'm getting ahead went out with amanjah today talk about blast from the past he was 45 minutes late a talker but not much of a conversationalist read he talked about himself the most cheaper than i remembered him adventurous which i can appreciate cause we ended up at this complex mag party i wanted to go to at the party i ran into various guys i know who all seemed ambiguously gay including nadia's brother who as adorable as he is had a high pitched voice and seemed unarguably gay overall an interesting night you know i love an adventure lets just hope i get up in time to go to the gym soo i just got through video chatting my freshman boo who by the way is not only not a freshman but 21 now he's so adorable like a puppy i just want to cuddle him as for the rest of my day work cooking etc nothing else of much note went to the gym even though i only got about 5 hours of sleep still chugging along though surprisingly that's about it today i tried to increase my productivity this included working at home went to work and briefly wanted to slap a coworker had a spinach salad and pooped watched television that left no mark decided not to go out with amanjah i couldn't fake interest twice in one week with the same person i don't have that much energy thought about writing more for money intended to come home and strike up a plan did not do it learned i may be receiving my check from left right tomorrow plotted on what i would do with it at least go to the bookstore talked to cdo briefly on gmail chat no comment tired worked stood up amanjah again wrote av an email like he was justin giles we'll see how that works they're going to new orleans for mardi gras i'm jealous went out to greek restaurant for restaurant week with friends it was fun but overpriced missed out on cool kids at the museum of natural history boo hoo but it would have been too expensive too late and no one really wanted to go except me but what else is new just got home and so glad to be here today i went to the gym and pushed it to the limit jogging out the last ten of my 30 minute run at 5 5 mph whoo hoo the man at the y gave me his number and while he does strike me to be a cool person i just don't know if i know me i'd be wasting his time after gym i went to the upper west side to get some hair stuff i like the upper west it's cute there's lots of different stuff there i decided i need to do more exploring out and about came home did my hair baked some brownies and took it down to wall street for paris' get together and so khaliah and i ended up talking until 5 in the am so this will be a two day replay so i went down to paris' anticipating any and everything khaliah said brooke's friends could be bougie and that made me nervous however by the time we made it down to wall street with my brownies ice cream humus and pita points and veggie platter with dip i basically brought the party it turned out me khaliah were the first to arrive i had fun though as i had already decided i would brooke actually entertains me with her bougieness and the only other person who came was carla who is engaged i couldn't believe it if only because well shit it's marriage and i swore she was single last year but as it turns out she's dated the same guy basically since senior year of college either which way she seemed very happy and we all had fun reminiscing about hu of course the thought was we were going to stay downtown because they live so far but their apartment is the hot two window death trap and there was no way i was going to get any type of rest there so we trekked it back uptown i guess khaliah was feeling a little chatty because while i sat at the computer trying to break down the day we get to talking about all types of stuff with love and marriage but eventually it ends up being a christien fest and the basic conclusion is that i love him and haven't really met anyone with whom i'd have the same rapport and i've kind of resigned myself to this that i don't care if the guy is tall or if he likes music or any of those other things he was the light of my life and he brought out a side of me that no one else did i was happy all the while i just couldn't see us coming back together evenly yoked i have years worth of writings about him and my feelings for him i never stopped loving him missing him what could he say or do that would compare to that to make me feel like the love was even i can't see it however somehow i have convinced so many around me that there's something more to us that something divine will interfere and bring us back together i don't know if that was persuasive subliminal talk on my behalf that has ingrained these people with my psychosis to sustain me through my doubt or if perhaps there really is something there and maybe they're right it's like all the stuff i say i feel about christien is what khaliah says she feels about chuck but whatever she and chuck are together christien and i are not so even if divine intervention is going to step in and miraculously intervene that which i cannot see or believe right now it is not for me to think about i have to deal with the here and now the day to day and what we have now is a very low functioning friendship and so that's what it is today i made my way out to montclair to visit jammal he's as cute as ever put on a little weight and everything his studio is really nice and his beats aren't too bad either it seems like he's really progressing as adorable as he is when we finally got to kissing i felt nothing maybe his lips were too small maybe i was thinking too much but something just wasn't right about it and so i feel like once again i just don't really like anyone and that's fine i'm not really sad just a bit discouraged like so this is what it's going to be me alone not that i ever had any disillusions about what me and the freshman boo were really doing i even kind of brought it up our cycle of communication 6 months on 1 year off but can see it all spread out in front of him his laidback style busy schedule lack of maturity he's sweet but i've never really felt comfortable talking to him about stuff like he doesn't listen and that's probably my biggest problem feeling comfortable talking to people i just don't want to feel like they're not listening so i don't say anything i let them talk about their life and perhaps i should be more forth coming share more things stop waiting for people to come and unlock my secrets but i do it anyway i was listening to his beats thinking of lyrics and melodies but i don't feel comfortable opening up to him about those trying things out i hate feeling like people are waiting for you to prove something i'm always afraid i won't be able to deliver i guess i need to get over some fear things i'll add that to my to do list i'm in my room now headphones in aimee mann making my stomach turn a bit with her rolling melody and haunting lyrics khaliah and chuck were laughing in the other room playing music loudly i couldn't focus didn't need the loudness of their lives to contrast so bluntly with the quietness of mines and so now it's me and aimee and my turning stomach and my wandering mind contemplating the end fast because not much to report work was annoying today too much hand holding collaborative efforts i really have to get my independent hustle on and i fell off the good eating wagon hard today though i didn't have lunch really i had ice cream tonight i know i sound anorexic but i'm saying my face is breaking out there has to be a correlation outside of that nothing to report in the flashiest of flashes today i kinda fucked up at work i didn't tell my boss about something i should have and consequently complicated things more than they needed to be luckily i took it all in stride knowing that all i needed was one fuck up to set me straight i'm back on my ps and qs focused i refuse to be put in that kind of preventable situation again aside from that no dice paris came over for help with her law school essay a critic told her to rewrite the whole thing and it's due friday however i enjoyed the challenge of it and wonder if there's an extra dime in advising essay writing or something in the end i think it turned out pretty good ice cream in my stomach the devil's elixir back to the gym for me tomorrow whoo hoo word doc holler at ur girl today i ate waaay too much not that i m turning anorexic but this ice cream is turning out to be the bane of my existence i feel so guilty every time and yet it keeps drawing me back got annoyed with the white boys i work with because well they re white boys and hence are inherently annoying the cokiness makes me want to slap to someone talked to cdo on gmail chat it was awkward the person who i felt like i could talk to forever i now have nothing to say to it s sad found out kanye was going on tour with nerd lupe and rhianna this made my head explode partially from the awesomeness but also because on my previous 5 am chat with khaliah i told her that the only time i d really step out of my character read do what i wanted to do and not feel dumb with christien is if nerd had a concert in nyc because he d be the only person i d want to go with and lo there is the concert doesn t mean i m going to invite him though i just don t know i can t take the sadness of it all it s like being around a ghost talked to anneka via email who notified me that her inbox has been flooded with resumes after the request she sent me she really doesn t know how real this minority game is when someone says they got the hook up you go i guess this is the section where i again say something about cdo but my mouth is too tired my mind weary i can t begin to detail how i think of him every day how he s in everything i do it s too much it s become subconscious i don t even try to stop myself anymore i just let myself drift away i try to be patient i try not to think the end but i just don t see the endpoint i like no one and those that i like don t like me the last friggin day and i fuck up oh well yesterday besides fucking up some more at work and not really caring i went out to dinner with sara she s her usually loud and raucous self we went to sea in bk it was fun always good to see people helped paris refine her law essay some more can t remember much else though i doubt there was that much to report
