Chillin. And it's nice. The way I like it, music and lights.

Today I went to work, it was the same old same old. Meetings calendar, repeat. 

I ain't mad at it though, Left Right was truly some dark employment days for me.

And those fools still ain't give me my last paycheck. I envisioned myself sending a scathing email that burnt them to their very core. Then I remember to pray that it doesn't come to that, because I honestly don't want to have to go through all that. I feel like I've been fighting over money for months now. First verizon, now this. I hate feeling like people are getting over on me because they think I'm too lazy to stalk them.

Talked to Lauren, she broke up with her boyfriend David. 

I'm kind of glad, if only because I know how easy it is for Lauren to convince herself of love, that she may never really know it in it's organic state.

But then again, do I?

Talked to Sandra, we decided I would try to "trick" AV into a date. I don't know if it's the best idea, but I truly do enjoy him, so we shall see how the spirit leads me tomorrow. 

Speaking of leading spirits, I prayed God would make the CDO situation clearer, that I would learn to love or let go. Still waiting to hear back. But I know he'll say something.
