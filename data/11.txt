night.

Listening to my moody "heartsick" playlist.

It's pretty good though, in a very sad way.

On the train ride down to 34th street Keysha asked about Christien.

And then I spiraled down, back in the mix of it all. Not in a horrible cry me a rive way, but just oh lord send me a sign so I can securely feel some type of way. Instead of this gray.

I had to write about it on the train, though it was really brief.

Luckily I just took a brief detour in vanity, via my cocophane of facebook pictures, and I'm back.

Fuck it all, that's what I think.

Today I helped Keysha and Shanel miss their bus, kill time to get on the next one, which included some nasty fried chicken wings (ok, i'm lying, they were good, but fried food is inherently nasty), and then finally saw them off on their bus ride back to DC.

Then it was back uptown and too the grocery store, where I spent WAY too much money, started my period at the checkout (it felt like a bubble was bursting, I swear I hate it), came back, enjoyed some leftovers and a magnolia's cupcake, and then did my hair, finally.

It came out ok.

Talked to Brad, which pretty much felt like nails on a chalk board. Ok, it wasn't that bad, but I really wasn't and do not enjoy his conversation. He does not capture my imagination.

But I also think I'm super analytical and difficult to deal with.

And... pessimistic. And reactionary. And self-depreciating.

Dear God,

Please send me a sign, a word, something, that I will love again. Or rather, more importantly, that I will love and it will be okay. I will not scare him or myself away. Please also let me know if that man is Christien Douglass Oliver.

Thanks,

Kia
