The last friggin day and I fuck up.Oh well.Yesterday, besides fucking up some more at work, and not really caring, I went out to dinner with Sara. She’s her usually loud and raucous self.We went to SEA in Bk. It was fun, always good to see people.Helped Paris refine her law essay some more.Can’t remember much else, though I doubt there was that much to report.
