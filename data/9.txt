Drunk.

Don't really know what to do with that.

Went out with the old l/r ppl.

AV was there. He's really like my best friend, this fool sticks by my side the whole night.

And still...

I am unsure.

But it matters not.

It would not work. Morally we are incompatible. So that is that, hang it up wood.

Today was busy, I got frustrated by calendar shenanigans, and Dan's complusion to get things done fast as opposed to right. But I try to remind myself to whoo sah, not take things so seriously.

I'll be okay. I still like my job.

Met keysha and shanel and nikki after drinks w/ l/r  at applebee's to say hi. Really don't want to do a day of tourism. Not really my kicks.

Really I'm conflicted about AV. Like I reallt enjoy his company. However I really believe I should spare myself the heartache,
