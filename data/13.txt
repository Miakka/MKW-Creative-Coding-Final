Almost forgot tonite. 

Almost.

Khaliah & Chuck are playing Alicia Keys in the other room. More annoying than Chuck being over here? Chuck being over here and having to listen to Alicia Keys.

It's slow torture, I know I'm going to wake up with her songs in my damn head.

And I just walked out my room in some short shorts, thinking they were both in the room, and lo, there he was.

Fuck it, it's my apartment too. You want to be here 3 days a week, that's what you're going to see.

Regardless, today started out rough.

No hot water, fight with maintenance man, sold ipod for too cheap ($200), learned I'll prob never see that check from left right. Boss' inability to adhere to a timely schedule, and general frantic disorganization.

But let us not dwell...

Instead I go to the end, Tamika's surprise party, where I'm in Whitney's apartment, dancing with pals to music that we sing. That made the day okay.
