In the flashiest of flashes...

Today I kinda fucked up at work. I didn't tell my boss about something I should have, and consequently complicated things more than they needed to be. 

Luckily, I took it all in stride, knowing that all I needed was one fuck up to set me straight. I'm back on my Ps and Qs focused, I refuse to be put in that kind of preventable situation again.

Aside from that, no dice.

Paris came over for help with her Law school essay. A critic told her to rewrite the whole thing, and it's due friday! However I enjoyed the challenge of it, and wonder if there's an extra dime in advising essay writing or something. 

In the end I think it turned out pretty good.

Ice cream in my stomach, the devil's elixir. Back to the gym for me tomorrow...
