Sleepy.

I go to bed exhausted, but then wake up an hour before my clock goes off.

Not much to report.

No word on the movies with AV. No idea what i'll do this weekend.

Maybe go to DC. Maybe stay here. Maybe go home to Buffalo.

Went to the gym today and my legs have been sore all day.

Watching the last king of scotland. Haven't said a word to Khaliah all day, and she's sitting on the other end of the couch. That's the awkward nature of our relationship.

I'm feeling some kind of way about a lot of things.

The whole perplexity of my feelings over AV. I practice being indifferent, but it's not really effective. I don't really want to be rejected. But who does?

I'm skeptical of my ability to have honest feelings for someone and not fuck it up in some way.

I babysit my inbox looking for signs, something to give me hope in things I cannot see.

I get nothing.

Not a response, not a text, not a call.

And for the most part I believe myself to be okay with it. I try to busy myself with other things, anything not to bemoan my current situation.

You know, the whole wanting what you have deal.

But it's only a few that I miss, and only one I believe has any hope for success, though it seems entirely far fetched at this point. 

So then what? 

I try not to think about it.

God has been particularly tight-lipped about this, I've not a glimmer of a sign that something is a stir, that help is on the way.

AV is the only person that I feel like I've genuinely liked in a long while, though it's not on a CDO level, and I have no idea of his feelings for me. I don't want the friend talk.

And even beyond that, the situation looks as if it would be so temporary, we're so different and I'm not even sure what his spiritual life is like, so I couldn't necessarily say that God hand picked him for me.

So I wait. Hoping. Waiting. Worrying.
