Congestion depleting.

as are spirits.

Day 2, strike 2.

Offender today was AV, who, besides giving what felt like a a lukewarm response to my email and completely ignoring my questions about love, launched into a diatribe about why he understands why the husband cheated on his wife because "men need sex."

And cut.

No need to go any further. No need to even respond to the email. I don't really need him as a friend. Granted I enjoy him as a friend, but no thanks.

I fear he may have been giving me very extensive mixed signals, and that would be way too traumatic to endure again. 

So my cynicism is up, optimism down.

I really don't see a love thing working out. With him or anyone. 

Besides that dive on the darkside an avarage day.

My boss drove me nuts with his tardiness and neediness, i really want to start yelling at him like he's a child. I feel like that would help.

However I'm learning to just dead myself to it, like whatever, if he's late that his explanation to spew.

Went to a Producer's Guild screening with Jenile at the Soho house. It's really fly, and I was torn between wanting to belong and never coming back again. Exclusivity has that effect on me most times.

It was a really awful movie about sex trafficking.

Home now, and tomorrow's Friday. Whoo. Hoo.

I need a boost. Or. God throw me a bone.
