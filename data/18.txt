I am definitely dropping the ball. 

I was in the bed, under the covers, when it occured to me.

Busy worrying about the what ifs of life, people's health, the unexpected turns that take place and turn your world on end.

My imagination runs away from me often.

Not much to report from today: MLK day, and yet mines was definitely a day off, i'm somewhat sad to report. Went to the gym. It was cold as hell outside, so I spent the rest of the day watching television.

Completely unproductive. But i think I deserved one day of slothfullness.

Spoke with Amanjah, an old LA jump off, we're supposed to get up tomorrow, so that should be interesting.

Watched the Wire, Brandon invited me to some party his mom is throwing him this weekend. I think I might go. I contemplated doing things with him that might confuse situations (besides just going there in the first place). Might do those things too though... what can I say, I guess I'm feeling a bit reckless, or selfish, or both. 

That said, rarely do the things I imagine come to pass.
