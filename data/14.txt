Quickly quickly, i am very sleepy.

Work was work. Meetings, calls, etc, repeat.

Khaliah haltingly invited me to DC for Renee's birthday. It felt like a pitiful after thought. I'm not sure if I would go, where would I stay, plus I hate feeling like the 5th wheel, and wishing I was back home... i'm not sure if I'm up for the trip.

Much rather just go to the movies with AV.

But who knows if that would really happen, and how much i'd enjoy it in the end. 

Still no email response from CDO.

I need some more hobbies, this pining after men I do not have schtick is getting old, and i really don't have many stories to tell these days...
