Tired.

Worked. Stood up Amanjah again.

Wrote AV an email like he was Justin Giles; we'll see how that works.

They're going to New Orleans for Mardi Gras, I'm jealous. 

Went out to Greek restaurant for restaurant week with friends. It was fun, but overpriced.

Missed out on Cool Kids at the Museum of Natural History. Boo hoo. But it would have been too expensive, too late, and no one really wanted to go.

Except me. But what else is new.
