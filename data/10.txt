More drinking but less drunk.

Sober really.

Today was a slightly touristy day filled with things I did not need to buy.

Like 2 $20 dresses from H&M.

And liquor. I never need to buy liquor.

However, I had fun. Keysha & Shanel crack me up, I had a good ten minute tears in the eye laugh about this guy on the train wearing nike sneakers and winnie the pooh socks.

H&M, then free cupcakes at Magnolia courtesy of the coach store on bleecker. Uptown to "change clothes" though not much change at all, on to SEA in brooklyn, where we met Nikki and Kelli. Kelli brought Jumar. They're a really strong couple to me. Who brings their boyfriend to dinner with the girls? Odd.

Finished the night at Jendayi's playing taboo with the folk. Good times. A good, clean Saturday night.
